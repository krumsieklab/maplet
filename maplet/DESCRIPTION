Description: maplet is an R package for statistical data analysis with a special focus on metabolomics datasets. It allows users to 
    create self-contained analytical pipelines. The toolbox builds upon the bioconductor package SummarizedExperiment (SE), which 
    serves as a central repository for each pipelineâ€™s data, analysis steps, and results. maplet provides a suite of functions for 
    interacting with this container including but not limited to data loading, annotation, statistical analysis, visualization, and 
    reporting. maplet is designed to work with a pipe operator - either the popular %>% operator from the magrittr package or the 
    recently introduced |> from base R. This operator allows for smooth connections between pipeline steps, without the need for 
    temporary variables or multiple assignments. The combination of these elements allows for the creation of pipelines which are 
    simple to follow, highly modular, and easily reproducible.
